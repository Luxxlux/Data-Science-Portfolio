Iris Classification Project
This project builds a complete end‑to‑end machine learning workflow using the classic Iris dataset. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualisation — a solid demonstration of core data‑science skills.

📘 Project Overview
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

using four numeric features:

sepal length

sepal width

petal length

petal width

This project walks through the full modelling pipeline using Python and scikit‑learn.

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
Loading and inspecting structured datasets

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Train/test splitting

Training multiple ML models

Comparing model performance

Visualising decision boundaries

Building and interpreting a confusion matrix

🛠️ Methods & Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:

k‑Nearest Neighbours (k‑NN)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Performance was compared using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

📊 Visualisations
The project includes:

Decision boundary plots (2D projection using petal features)

Scatter plots of feature relationships

Confusion matrix visualisation

Images are stored in the images/ folder.
